# CAD Notes
Solid models are presented for:
<ul>
<li>The OEM console retrofit. A pair of 3D printed parts is presented. 
<li>The custom coupler that you'll need if you don't have one from Nye Viking
<li>A work-alike console you can construct if you want a Nye Viking Power Meter and you
don't have a Nye Viking OEM console.
</ul>
<p>The CAD layout was done with <a href='https://resources.sw.siemens.com/en-US/download-solid-edge-community-edition'>Solid Edge Community Edition</a>.
All the models are exported in STEP format, which is supported by many 3D modeling tools and
3D printer slicers.</p>
<p>In the console folder are three different console designs. <code>console2.asm</code> is
the recommended design and is what is in the photographs.</p>
<p>The one in console.asm is complete
in the sense that if you print all its parts, you can assemble a Nye Viking workalike. I am
not satisfied with its cosmetics and have a console3.asm layout in that folder that, as of this
writing, is simply a concept. The console3 design does not have printable 3D parts.
<p>The coupler design has one 3D printed part, a spacer to 
make more clearance for the 4-pin connector solder lugs. And it is useful as a template for
a drilling template for the necessary holes in the Hammond Aluminum box.</p>
