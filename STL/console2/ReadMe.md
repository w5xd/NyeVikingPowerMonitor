# Console 3D print and assembly procedure
<ul>
The names of the parts are:
<ul>
<li><code>Base2.stl</code> is the main part, the biggest one
<li><code>Front Panel 2.stl</code>
<li><code>Back Panel 2.stl</code>
<li><code>meter backlight cover.stl</code>
<li><code>back cover 2.stl</code>
<li><code>knob.stl</code>
</ul>
<li>
The <code>Front Panel 2</code> and <code>Back Panel 2</code> parts are best printed with a small nozzle: 0.25mm.
Change filament color at or before 1mm to make the text have a different background color.
</li>
<li><code>Base2</code> prints best with some selected supports. See <code>Base2.3mf</code>.
</ul>

The five piece 3D printed console enclosure is compact and can be a bit of a puzzle to
assemble. The order listed below makes sure you can access all the nuts and screws when
you need to.
<ol>
<li>There are slots for 7 #4 machine screw square nuts in Base2. Place all of them.
The ones that won't stay in with friction, use cellophane tape to keep them in place.
<li>Wire both the AA cell holders to each other and the PCB.  
<li>Wire all 6 LEDs on flying wires to the PCB.
<li>Fasten the PCB with two #4 machine screws. There are 3 mounting posts. Use only
the two closest to the front panel.
<li>Fasten the horizontal AA cell holder. The + side is against the back panel. The
horizontal one is the one whose + side is wired to the PCB (as opposed to the other
AA cell holder.) Use two #2 x 3/16" machine screws. Do not over tighten.
<li>Solder 3 wires between the front panel Hold Time pot and its 3 pin connector.
Route the connector wire through the hole in the base and plug it into the
connector on the PCB.
<li>Solder 3 wires between the SP3T and its connector. Route the connector through
the hole in the base.
<li>Place the meters and screw them down.
<li>Place the vertical AA meter and screw it down.
<li>Put the potentiometer and the SP3T and LEDs in their front panel holes.
<li>Place two #4 square nuts in the front panel. Use tape to keep them in place.
<li>Use the strain reliefs in the <code>meter backlight cover.stl</code> to hold
the wires to the 12V LEDs meter lights. Solder the wires to a connector.
<li>Place the <code>Back Panel 2.stl</code> and fasten with one #4 screw.
<li>Place the <code>back cover 2.stl</code> and fasten the lower two #4 screws.
<li>Place the <code>meter backlight cover.stl</code> and fasten with two
#4 screws through the three parts.
</ol>
