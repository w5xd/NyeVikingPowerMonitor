# Nye Viking Power Monitor
Brain transplant for Nye Viking Power Monitor RFM-003

My old RFM-003 quit working. The single circuit board in it is an analog computer that converts the two voltages from a directional coupler (forward and reflected) to an SWR meter reading and an RF Power meter reading. After switching out the obvious parts, I gave up and bought an Arduino UNO single-board computer and its mating Proto Shield circuit board. I built a replacement for the Power Monitor's original circuit board. This repo documents the hardware and software used.
